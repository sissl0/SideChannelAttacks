- (1) If the Linux Kernel version including configuration is known the location of "linux_banner" string is known. Check 2⁹ addresses to get shift (Linux kernel starting address only determined by 9 bits entropy)
- (2) With the KASLR_SHIFT and known PA the DIRECT_VA = KASLR_SHIFT + 0xFFFF 8880 0000 0000 + PA . The byte can be detemined by transient execution and passed through a covert channel
- (3) same

illegal loads are still executed but the accessed data is zeroed out. But if the kernel address is valid, spec load executes quick while if unmapped, page fault takes longer. With knowing valid kernel address, KASLR_SHIFT can be calculated.
