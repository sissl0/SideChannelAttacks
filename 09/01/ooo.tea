# Out-of-order execution example - using memory access to create delay
addi x1, x0, 0x100   # 1: Set address
lw x2, 0(x1)         # 2: Load from memory (SLOW - cache miss)
addi x3, x0, 42      # 3: Independent - can execute while #2 waits
add x4, x2, x3       # 4: Depends on x2 and x3
add x5, x4, x0       # 5: Depends on x4
