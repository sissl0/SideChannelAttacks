# Exercise 1
All values except 0x01 are checked, because b_{-1} XOR 0x01 XOR 0x01 = b_{-1}.
Therefore the ciphertext byte remains unchangend. Sending it to the oracle will always return "Valid". If none of the other 255 values produce a "Valid" response, we can conclude by elimination that the plaintext byte was indeed 0x01.

# Exercise 2
Padding is 0x01. For 0x01 and 0x02 no error. The rest returns Padding Error.

# Exercise 3
13 refers to the 13 byte header field in the TLS record protocol which is used for HMAC calculation. The size of the header pushes the hash function duration to be longer (Needs to calculate 2 blocks instead of 1). The time differnce between 1 and 2 blocks allows a side channel padding oracle.
