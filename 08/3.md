## Exercise 3
It's non-trivial because the clock cycle at target operation is unknown and the power traces might not be perfectly aligned.

An alternative way to to test $K'=K$ is $\sum_{t'}|\Delta(K',t')|>|\Delta(K'',t')|$ for all $K''\neq K'$. This finds the K' with the highest correlation over the whole time.
