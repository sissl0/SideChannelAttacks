##  Exercise 1
Access Level: PA4, AA2 \
Privileges required: 
- Can trigger repeated executions with chosen inputs
- Can measure execution time of cryptographic operations
- Can observe power consumption or electromagnetic emissions
- Has access to the same hardware/software as the victim 

Attacker goals:
- Recover secrets

No, for example power attacks are still possible. Because two instructions with the different complexity but constant time still consume different levels of power. Also Cache attacks are time independent.

## Exercise 2
- (1) ECDSA Signature
- (2) modular inversion
- (3) extended Euclidean algorithm
- (4) Fermat's little Theorem
- (5) masked nonce
- (6) because the mask of 32 bits was to small. The nonce could be bruteforced

## Exercise 3
- (1) electromagnetic radiation
- (2) The number of iterations in the Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- (3) Partial bits of the masked nonce
- (4) No
- (5) Lattice attack (Hidden Number Problem): collecting multiple signatures with partial nonce leakage allows recovery of the private key using lattice reduction

## Exercise 4
#### 1. Replace the Algorithm
- **Use Fermat's Little Theorem** for modular inversion: `k⁻¹ ≡ k^(n-2) mod n`
- This is inherently constant-time (fixed number of operations)
- Eliminates the variable iteration count that leaks information

#### 2. Larger Masking Parameter
- Increase mask size from 32 bits to **64+ bits**
- Makes brute-forcing the mask computationally infeasible
- Trade-off: slightly slower performance

#### 3. Constant-Time Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- Implement EEA with fixed number of iterations (always run maximum iterations)
- Add dummy operations for shorter executions
- Ensures identical execution pattern regardless of input

#### 4. Hardware-Level Countermeasures
- **EM shielding**: Physical shielding to reduce electromagnetic emanations
- **Noise injection**: Add random noise to power/EM signals
- **Balanced logic**: Use dual-rail logic to equalize power consumption

#### 5. Blinding Techniques
- **Randomize the base point** in ECDSA computations
- **Projective coordinate randomization**: Add randomness to intermediate values
- Makes correlation between traces difficult

## Exercise 5
DSA, RSA-CRT, RSA key gen, Point multiplication in ECDH.
EUCLEAK is critical to  any use of variable-time modular inversion on secret data.
